            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>My Home</strong><br>
                I'm sitting in MY home right now. The keys are on the counter. The space is mine. No landlord, no rent checks - just my place. It feels incredible waking up here every day knowing this is mine.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>MacBook Pro M5 16"</strong><br>
                This machine is perfect. Typing on it right now - the keyboard feels premium, the screen is stunning. 120Hz mini-LED, ProMotion, the works. Traded in my old MacBook when the M5 dropped in 2026. The performance is unreal. Everything I need, right here.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Cuban Gold Chain</strong><br>
                The weight of my $2k Cuban chain around my neck reminds me it's real. It catches the light perfectly. Solid gold. When I look in the mirror, I see success looking back. This chain represents everything I've built.

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong><br>
                My iPhone 17 Pro Max is sitting next to me - fully paid off. No monthly payments hanging over me. The titanium feels premium in my hand. Latest tech, zero debt on it. That's the move.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Apple Watch Ultra</strong><br>
                My Apple Watch Ultra just buzzed on my wrist. The build quality is insane. Action button, sapphire crystal, the orange detail. It's become an extension of me.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Christmas Handled</strong><br>
                All the Christmas gifts are wrapped and ready. Brother's getting his TSLA shares, sister's getting her ATZ shares, parents and grandparents have their gift cards. I handled it weeks ago because I had the funds. No stress, no scrambling. Feels good being able to give without worry.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Perfect Health & Body</strong><br>
                I look in the mirror and I'm in the best shape of my life. Energy is high, body feels strong, mind is sharp. I wake up feeling good every single day. My body works perfectly - no aches, no issues, just pure vitality. I'm healthy, I'm fit, I'm thriving.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Wealth & Abundance</strong><br>
                Money flows to me effortlessly. My portfolio is solid and growing. TFSA sitting healthy, emergency fund locked in, investments compounding. I'm financially free. No stress about bills, no anxiety about money. I'm rich in every sense - money, health, happiness, freedom.
            </div>

            <div class="reality-item">
                <strong>Happiness & Peace</strong><br>
                I'm genuinely happy. Not chasing happiness - I'm living it. My mind is at peace. I wake up grateful, go to sleep content. Life is good and getting better. I'm exactly where I'm meant to be, with everything I need.

        <div class="affirmation">
            <p><strong>This is not a dream. This is not a goal. This is my reality.</strong></p>
            <p>I am healthy. I am happy. I am rich.</p>
            <p>I own my home. I have everything I need.</p>
